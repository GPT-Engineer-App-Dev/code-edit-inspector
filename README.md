# code-edit-inspector

For the first task, load the CSV data provided in the user's request into the app.

- Use PapaParse or a similar CSV parsing library to parse the CSV data 
- Store the parsed data in the app's state
- Display the raw data in a simple table for now just to confirm it loaded correctly
- Don't worry about any other functionality yet, we'll add that in the next tasks
